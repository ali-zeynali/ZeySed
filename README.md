# ZeySed, A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Detection of Plant Diseases

This study aims to classify plant leaves into three groups of (i) healthy, (ii) powdery mildew, and (iii) leaf rust. Images were taken from different plants are used to train and test the model. We propose ZeySed, a customized/tuned neural network that classifies the plant leaves images into these three classes.
